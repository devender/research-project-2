## Synopsis

__This research was done as part of Cousera course **Reproducable Research**.__

Utilizing the storm dataset provided by The U.S National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) we try to answer some basic questions about severe weather events specifically the following questions:

1. Across the US, which types of events are the most harmful with respect to population health ?
1. Across the US, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences ?

The code used to publish these results are available on GitHub at this [repository](https://github.com/devender/research-project-2).
